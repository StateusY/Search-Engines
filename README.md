### Poke-Search

In an attempt to make my program as modular and useful as possible, I have implemented command line flags. This display system emulates a terminal line, which only accepts flags. Get started with --help. Using this system, the user can sort based on name, index, and stats. After this selection, the program searches for the pokemon with that specific name/index and uses it's stats as the comparison. The stats search bypasses this.

**THE SORT IS BROKEN RIGHT NOW BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS**
